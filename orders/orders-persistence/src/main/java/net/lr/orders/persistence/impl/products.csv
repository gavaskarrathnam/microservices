1,AppGen,Application Generation Framework,2016-01-01,Hexaware,AppProduct,AppGen is a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) based code generation engine to generate Java platform source code for various popular open source (OS) libraries such as EJB/Hibernate/Spring/JSF 1 with ADF/JSF 2 with Primefaces/Struts 2 and Web Services. It transforms UML models into deployable components and facilitates layer wise independent code generation. Typically it takes a UML model in XMI format as input and generates source code as output.  The generated application code is complaint with the project coding standards and the best practices.,http://www.materializecss.com/images/office.jpg,picture_in_picture
